# organization_name_disambiguation_ACV_methodology

This repository includes the code of an algorithm developed in R for organization name disambiguation. In particular, it is a hybrid methodology (largely automated + manual check) to identify equivalences between labels (i.e., the ways in which organization names are reported in the raw dataset).

Moreover, it also includes a workspace containing data on the first three EU Framework Programmes (data downloaded from https://cordis.europa.eu/ on October 1st, 2021). This data represents the application case reported in the paper mentioned below.  

An accurate description of the methodology is in a scientific paper accepted for publication in Scientometrics, titled "A novel methodology to disambiguate organization names: an application to EU Framework Programmes data", and authored by Ancona A., Cerqueti R., & Vagnani G. (2023).
