# organization_name_disambiguation_ACV_methodology

This repository includes the code of an algorithm developed in R for organization name disambiguation. In particular, it is a hybrid methodology (largely automated + manual check) to identify equivalences between labels (i.e., the ways in which organization names are reported in the raw dataset).

Moreover, it also includes a workspace containing data on the first three EU Framework Programmes (data downloaded from https://cordis.europa.eu/ on October 1st, 2021). This data represents the application case reported in the paper mentioned below.  

An accurate description of the methodology can be found in a scientific paper published in Scientometrics: "Ancona, A., Cerqueti, R. & Vagnani, G. (2023). A novel methodology to disambiguate organization names: an application to EU Framework Programmes data. Scientometrics 128, 4447â€“4474, https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-023-04746-x."
